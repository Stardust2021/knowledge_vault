-to perfrom task without programming the computer

**Training data->trains ML algorithm->build a model**

**Test data->model->predicting** 

Dataset-collection of data in the form of numerical, image, videos etc
Database-set of organized data and accessed by DBMS

 ###### learning method
 **input data->abstraction->generalization**
 
 1.**Input Data**-past data use it to predict the future
 
 2.**Abstraction**-data represented in a broader way through underlying algorithm
 
 3.**Generaliztion**-the abstracted representation is genrealized to form a framework for making decisions
