Supervised learning - perdective learning machine predicts the class of unknown objects based on prior class related information of similar objects

-   Oversee or direct a certain activity and make sure its done correctly.
    
-   Machine learns under guidance.
    
-   Giving labeled input to train.
    
-   Teach machines using labeled data.
    
-   Based on the training data, the machine builds a predictive model that can be used on test data to assign a label for each record in the test data
-   **Popular algorithm:**
 **Linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, KNN,RF**

- Applications:
Forecasting sales profit, Risk evaluation
    
Types
1.classification 
-   classification is Predicting a label or a class.
    
-   Example: Apple and not an apple, Spam and non-spam mails (contains two classes, so classification alg). Having only 2 possibilities (ip address, domain reputation, etc)
2.regression
-   regression is predicting a continuous quantity (continuous variable  is infinite number of possibilities).
    
-   Predictive analysis used to predict continuous variable
    
-   Example :Person’s weight. 50kg,50.1kg,50.7kg etc. number of possibilities for weights are limitless.
    
-   Price of a stock over some period of time.
