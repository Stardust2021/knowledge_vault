- they **uniquely identifes** a  device on a network and define where it is **located**
- The **router** uses the destination IP address of the packet to identify where to send the packet,and routing algorithms determine the best route to get it there

### NOTE
       
when use a office network our ip address may or may  not be unique 
 but when we access the internet every devices has a unique address 
 
IP4 ran out of numbers 
so IP6 was introduced

**Packet switching**- the process of sending data using a router
No fixed path is created between the communicating device each packet can take differnet route to reach its destination

the ip address of google is 172.217.7.238 it difficult to remember - enter domain
